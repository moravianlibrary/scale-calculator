<h2>On antique maps´ scale</h2>
<p>
  The application is a tool for quick determination of the scale on antique maps.
  It is suitable for setting the scale, which was put into historical formats
  using both historical units of measurement and the metric system, in the
  currently used format 1:M.
</p>
<p>
  The scale on antique maps, both manuscript and printed, is usually put in two
  ways: no figure at all or so called graphic scale (a line segment). The
  application enables setting of the scale in both cases. It is intended to help
  librarians and archivists building catalogues and databases, historical
  cartographers and laymen interested in antique maps. It is not intended to
  substitute carto-metric analyses when using advanced tools used in digital
  cartography. That is why the calculation is approximate and it is necessary to
  round the gained figures.

<p>
  The following unites of measurement used in Central Europe in the Early Modern
  Era are taken in the account:
